Regression is performed using Deep Learning with Keras and scikit-learn to explore whether priority should be given towards 'more no. of epochs' or 'no. of hidden layers'. Also, the effect of 'normalization' of predictor variables on 'mean' and 'standard deviation' of 'Mean Squared Error' is explored.
